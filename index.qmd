# Some questions to ponder

---

### What proportion of findings in the published scientific literature (in the fields you care about) are *actually true*?

-   100%
-   90%
-   70%
-   50%
-   30%

## How do we define what "*actually true*" means?

---

### Is there a reproducibility crisis in science?

-   Yes, a significant crisis
-   Yes, a slight crisis
-   No crisis
-   Don't know

{{< include _toothbrush-culture-mishel.qmd >}}

## Do you agree or disagree with Mischel?

- Do we treat other people's theories like toothbrushes?
- Are we building a cumulative psychological science?
- Should we be?
- If so, how?

# A Manifesto for Reproducible Science

[@munafo_manifesto_2017]

## When (and why) would someone write a manifesto?

![](include/img/manifesto-definition.png)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

![[@munafo_manifesto_2017]](https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41562-016-0021/MediaObjects/41562_2016_Article_BFs415620160021_Fig1_HTML.jpg?as=webp){#fig-munafo-2017}

## Recommendations

- [[Table 1 from @munafo_manifesto_2017]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-016-0021/tables/1)

## Your reactions?

- Do the proposed solutions seem like the right ones?
- Are they feasible?
- Are these the "right" stakeholders to consider?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

{{< include _feynmann.qmd >}}

## Reactions to Feynmann

- Are you fooling yourself? Are others?
- Is that bad? How do we avoid it?
- Do scientists have an obligation to 'bend over backwards' to show how they might be wrong?
- Should all results, null or contradictory to a prediction be published?
- Why or why not?

# Many Analysts, One Dataset

[@Silberzahn2018-st]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

> "Twenty-nine teams involving 61 analysts used the same data set to address the same research question: whether soccer referees are more likely to give red cards to dark-skin-toned players than to light-skin-toned players."

[@Silberzahn2018-st]

## Strategies among teams

![[@Silberzahn2018-st]](include/img/silberzahn-table-1.jpeg)

## Consequences

![[@Silberzahn2018-st]](include/img/silberzahn-fig-2.gif){#fig-silberzahn-fig-2}

## Beliefs change over time?

![[@Silberzahn2018-st]](include/img/silberzahn-fig-4.gif){#fig-silberzahn-fig-4}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

>"Here, we have demonstrated that as a result of researchers' choices and assumptions during analysis, variation in estimated effect sizes can emerge even when analyses use the same data."

[@Silberzahn2018-st]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

>"These findings suggest that significant variation in the results of analyses of complex data may be difficult to avoid, even by experts with honest intentions."

[@Silberzahn2018-st]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

>"The best defense against subjectivity in science is to expose it."

[@Silberzahn2018-st]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

>"Transparency in data, methods, and process gives the rest of the community opportunity to see the decisions, question them, offer alternatives, and test these alternatives in further research."

[@Silberzahn2018-st]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Example from a related field [@Botvinik-Nezer2020-wr]](include/img/botvinick-nezer-nature-2020.png){#fig-botvinick-nezer-etal-2020}

---

>"The flexibility of analytical approaches is exemplified by the fact that **no two teams chose identical workflows** to analyse the data. This flexibility resulted in **sizeable variation in the results of hypothesis tests**, even for teams whose statistical maps were highly correlated at intermediate stages of the analysis pipeline..."

[@Botvinik-Nezer2020-wr]

---

>"Our findings show that **analytical flexibility can have substantial effects on scientific conclusions**...The results emphasize the **importance of validating and sharing complex analysis workflows**, and demonstrate the need for performing and reporting multiple analyses of the same data."

[@Botvinik-Nezer2020-wr]

## Reactions to a many analysts approach

- What does it mean when analysts take different approaches to the same data and find different things? Or similar things?
- How could a 'many analysts' approach be helpful/harmful?
- How does a 'many analysts' approach contradict conventional thinking about data analysis?
- Are researchers sufficiently transparent about their data, methods, and processes?
- Why or why not?

## Are statistics alone enough?

- Do our figures show the effects our statistics detect?
- "Plot your data!" -- [Mike Meyer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mike-meyer-0056578a/)
- [Failure](https://psu-psychology.github.io/psych-490-reproducibility-2023-fall/surveys/many-viz.html) to "see" the effect, despite trying hard to

## Your thoughts?

- Do you plot your data first?
- Why or why not?
- Do you "script" figure generation? Have you had to regenerate figures when something changes?

# Easing in to open science

[@Kathawalla2021-tk]{.center}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

>"This article provides a roadmap to assist graduate students and their advisors to engage in open science practices...We give graduate students ideas on how to approach conversations with their advisors/collaborators, ideas on how to integrate open science practices within the graduate school framework, and specific resources on how to engage with each behavior..."

[@Kathawalla2021-tk]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

>"We emphasize that **engaging in open science behaviors need not be an all or nothing approach**, but rather graduate students can engage with any number of the behaviors outlined."

[@Kathawalla2021-tk]

## Your thoughts?

- Do these recommendations seem sensible to you?
- Have you had success implementing new practices in your research group?
- Have you encountered any barriers?
- Are there any practices you'd like to try?
- Remaining barriers?
